# How to contribute

Write your own algorithms in src/index.js and see if you can increase the accuracy of anime episode detection.

You can see a lot of failing test when running `npm test`. Read the predefined dataset in test/answers.txt which test against the program.

You may not agree with the answers specified in the text file. Please open an issue and discuss.

The list test/answer.txt is frequently updated (at least daily) with latest files names found on internet. So the accuracy would change over time.
